Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows us a streamlined way to make changes to our code(and back up
our code) that us, the instructors, and our groupmates can see.  This is also
good practice for when we use Git at a job in the future.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to work done in Conservation.
For example: A non-profit organization that wants to keep close watch on
endangered species and their habitats may use sensory technology to collect
data around what species are co-habitating, what the current state of their
habitat is like, and new births/deaths of the species.  Data science can be
applied to every field.
