Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to work done in Conservation.
For example: A non-profit organization that wants to keep close watch on
endangered species and their habitats may use sensory technology to collect
data around what species are co-habitating, what the current state of their
habitat is like, and new births/deaths of the species.  Data science can be
applied to every field.
