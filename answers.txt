Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows us a streamlined way to make changes to our code(and back up
our code) that us, the instructors, and our groupmates can see.  This is also
good practice for when we use Git at a job in the future.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to work done in Conservation.
For example: A non-profit organization that wants to keep close watch on
endangered species and their habitats may use sensory technology to collect
data around what species are co-habitating, what the current state of their
habitat is like, and new births/deaths of the species.  Data science can be
applied to every field.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging preserves the commit history(and their order) of both branches.
Rebasing rewrites the commit history to be one history, which is cleaner, but
may not preserve the order the commits happened on the different branches.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to having a more chill semester than last.  I made
it through 330 and 351, and I am now taking courses that I want to take.  I look
forward to learning applicable skills for a job in this class, and I am
excited to finally be using Python in a CMSC course.  I have a non-technical
job right now at a company based in DC, and I am actually trying to investigate if I can get a data science internship for the summer with them, and
potentially turn that into a full-time job come December.
